                    <p>The Children's Trust is a charity that helps children with brain injuries, and we value their work. That's why we'll be driving across Europe for 12 hours to raise as much awareness and funds as we can for this awesome charity. The event is scheduled to take place on the 11th February, and we'd love to see as many of you there as possible!</p>
