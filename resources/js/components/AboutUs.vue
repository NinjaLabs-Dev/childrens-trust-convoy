                    <p>The Children's Trust is a charity that helps children with brain injuries, and we value their work. That's why we're driving for 24 hours in convoy to raise funds and awareness for this amazing charity. On the 12th and 13th February we'll be driving across the entirety of Europe in ETS2, to have an awesome day and night, and raise as much money as we can.</p>
